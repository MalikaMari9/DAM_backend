# Fixes_2026-02-15

## Summary of Work
- Added OpenAQ pollution Mongo config (DB/collection) and accessor.
- Added public `/pollution/openaq` endpoint with required `year`, optional `country_name` and `pollutant`, and metric toggle (`value|avg|min|max|median`).
- Implemented trimmed payload with `metric_value` and descending sort by selected metric.
- Added OpenAQ schemas, controller, repository, and router registration.
- Added health IMHE country summary variant that includes OpenAQ PM2.5 coverage-weighted averages.
