# Fixes_2026-02-14

## Summary of Work
- Added health IMHE upload endpoints for CSV background processing and manual record insertion.
- Enforced health-only uploads with org country validation against CSV location_name.
- Manual uploads now derive IDs from Mongo by name; generate next available ID when missing.
- Manual uploads now hardcode population group to `All Population` (id=1).
- Manual uploads now omit upper/lower and default them to val.
- Added upload record list/edit/delete endpoints backed by Mongo batch data.
- Added CSV validate/confirm flow with duplicate detection and 50MB limit (in-memory cache).
- Added dupe pagination endpoint for CSV validation (5 per page).
- Confirm ignores duplicate insert errors; validate returns token expiry.
- Inserted IMHE rows into Mongo with batch metadata and updated upload status to PROCESSED/FAILED.
- Increased default max upload size to 25MB (configurable via `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`).
